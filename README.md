sfdc-vf-dynamic-fieldset
========================

A code sample demonstrating how to do dynamic binding on a Fieldset with v25 of the Salesforce API and Apex/Visualforce.

This assumes that you have three Lead fieldsets: 
* Lead_Detail
* Description_Information
* Additional_Information

In the PreV25FieldSetSample, changing the fieldset itself requires editing the VF page.  FieldSetSample does not require editing the VF page.
